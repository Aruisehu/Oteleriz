      p1_html: "After having discovered &#171; L’Avenue des Gourmets &#187; in 2016,&#171; Eater National &#187; in 2014 and&#171; Le S &#187; in 2012 for the older of us, we wanted to create our own project of entrepreneurship."
      p2_html: "We are 19 students in Hospitality & Catering industry and we have the chance to create our own Start'Up. After having elected the different members in each department, we began to define our concept. This is what characterizes our company, which differentiated us on the Egast exhibition, professional event gathering all the professionals of the Hotel and Catering industry. We are proud to present you &#171; Cook Me Up &#187;, our pop’up restaurant."
      p3_html: "Thanks to &#171; Entreprendre Pour Apprendre &#187;, we get advices and support throughout our adventure. Our school also supports us in our approach by allowing us to use its premises for our daily operations : meetings, cooking tests in particular, while keeping our independence and an identity quite distinct from that of the high school. In fact, each student participates in this project on a voluntary basis and in parallel with studies"
      p4_html: "This adventure allows us to participate in the creation of a company and all it includes: personnel management, choice of suppliers, definition of a concept, cost control ... but also a personal and professional enrichment. In addition, the charity aspect is an important point of the outcome of our project: all our profits will be given to various charities in the region."
      p5_html: "A unique and rewarding project that we hope will make you want to follow us."
